# devvit

there should be three folders here.

- `shared`: functions or classes you think will both benefit the client and server.
- `mod`: functions or classes you think will benefit public-api users with a global Devvit Instance without a real benefit for devvit web users.
- `web`: functions or classes you think will benefit devvit web users without a real benefit for public-api users with a global Devvit Instance.
