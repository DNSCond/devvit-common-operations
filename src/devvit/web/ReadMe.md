# devvit/web

there should be three folders here.

- `shared`: for the devvit web shared folder. functions or classes you think will both benefit the client and server.
- `server`: for the devvit web server folder. functions or classes you think will benefit server without a real benefit for the client.
- `client`: for the devvit web server folder. functions or classes you think will benefit client without a real benefit for the server.
