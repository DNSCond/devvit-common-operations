## how to use

1. look for a file you want to include in your project.
2. create a file in your project's relavant folder with the same name or a name you choose.
3. copy the text of the file.
4. paste the contents in the file.
5. either use `npm install <dependancy>` or add the dependancy to the `package.json` of the dependancys listed by the creator.
6. `npm install`.
7. [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) it in your project.
8. now you can use a single function or multiple!
